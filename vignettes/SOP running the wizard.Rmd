SOP: Using the ProteomicsML Wizard

Purpose
The run_proteomics_wizard() function provides a guided, interactive interface for proteomics data analysis. It allows researchers to perform standard workflows (differential expression, pathway enrichment, dimensionality reduction, machine learning, clustering) without needing to write R code.

Step 1. Prepare your data
Save your proteomics expression matrix as a CSV file in wide format:
Rows = proteins/genes.
Columns = samples.
First row (or second row) contains group labels (e.g., Normal, Tumour).
The first column contains protein IDs.
Example (simplified):
Gene	Sample1	Sample2	Sample3	Sample4	Sample5	Sample6
Group	Normal	Normal	Normal	Tumour	Tumour	Tumour
TP53	5.1	4.8	5.3	7.2	6.9	7.5
EGFR	2.0	1.8	2.1	3.5	3.7	3.6

Step 2. Install and load ProteomicsML
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("arunkumaran07/Proteome")
# library(ProteomicsML)

Step 3. Launch the wizard
# run_proteomics_wizard()
This will display a menu in your R console:
=== ProteomicsML: Analysis Wizard ===
1: Differential expression + volcano
2: Reactome summary across comparisons (dot-plots)
3: PCA / t-SNE / PLS-DA
4: Machine learning: LASSO + Random Forest
5: Heatmap + module detection + enrichment
6: Quit

Step 4. Select an analysis
Type the number corresponding to the desired analysis and press Enter.
Differential expression + volcano
Identify proteins significantly altered between groups (e.g., Normal vs Tumour).
Produces volcano plots showing fold-change and significance.
Reactome summary across comparisons
Summarize pathway enrichment results across multiple cancer datasets.
Dot plots highlight top pathways activated or suppressed.
PCA / t-SNE / PLS-DA
Visualize whether samples cluster by group.
Helps assess whether tumour and normal samples separate clearly.
Machine learning (LASSO + Random Forest)
Train classifiers to predict tumour vs normal.
Reports accuracy via confusion matrices.
Highlights proteins most predictive of cancer status.
Clustering + enrichment
Detect modules of co-regulated proteins.
Test modules for GO / KEGG enrichment.
Explore functional themes of cancer-related modules.
